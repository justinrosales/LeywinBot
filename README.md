## What I want the bot to achieve ðŸ¤”

#### All Purpose Functions

- [x] **Moderation:** Manage messages, kick/ban users, auto assign roles.
- [ ] **Custom Embeds:** Set up custom welcome messages
- [x] **Slash Commands:** Unique interactions, _/nanny_ to shout out my :goat: NANNYZPQ!

#### Would be nice

- [ ] **Play Music:** Might make another bot for this but I want this bot to do everything.
- [ ] **Create Built-in Anime/Manga/Manhwa list:** Something similar to MAL but built into a discord bot. Allows users to keep track of their favorite reads/shows, rate them, and share them with other members in the server.
